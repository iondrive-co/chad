---- Repeated failures ----

Ask the coding agent to answer the following questions:
- Is this a temporary fix or will it work in the future?
- What about the structure of the code cause so many failed attempts to fix this? 
- How could the code be improved so that fewer attempts are needed for similar issues in the future?
- Is there any redundant code from the failed attempts that could be removed?
